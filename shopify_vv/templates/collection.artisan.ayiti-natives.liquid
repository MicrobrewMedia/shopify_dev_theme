        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <img src="{{ 'Aiyti-Idea-1.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>After working with Estée Lauder and gaining prestige beauty business experience, Caroline Sada had a great passion for bringing the world natural Haitian beauty. She returned to Haiti in March of 2010 to work with her people after the disastrous earthquake that left her country in rubble and stole the lives of many. Ayiti Natives Co. was founded in December of 2011.</p>

        <img src="{{ 'Aiyti-Craft-1.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>Ayiti Natives is a line of natural products based on nature’s most precious essential oils, herbs and nuts that are native to Haiti which are anti-fungal, anti-oxidizing and anti-bacterial. Ayiti Natives respect all the norms of fair trade and their packaging is made of 100% recycled materials in collaboration with Paula Coles Haiti and The Apparent Project.</p>

        <img src="{{ 'Rev-Slider-School-Img2.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>Caroline Sada generously invested indevelopment of one of the poorest communities in Bois Neuf, Cite Soleil. She started a school, Institution Mixte Union des Apotres, shortly after her return to Haiti in 2010 with PRODEV (www.prodevhaiti.org), which provides free education and supplies to 300 students in a village of 30,000 people. </p>

              <h2>ONE ARTISAN AT A TIME</h2>
              <h5>The Mission of {{collection.title}}</h5>
              <p>Urban Zen aims to help develop, market and present the work of Haiti artisans to the western world. As an ambassador to the preservation of Haiti’s artistry and expression, Donna Karan and a community of supporters have been traveling to Haiti at every opportunity, working one-on-one with the artists and manufacturers. “The artistry and skill is breathtaking,” Donna says. “I am so inspired by what I am seeing and the people with whom I’m working with. I couldn’t be more excited.”</p>

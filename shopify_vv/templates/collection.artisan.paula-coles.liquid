        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <img src="{{ 'Paula-Idea-1.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>Paula Coles admires the Haitian people who, in spite of their limited resources, produce magnificent objects with all types of refuse materials. After watching enormous trucks filled with remnants leaving her family’s T-shirt factory, Paula had the idea to sell them and use the money to support schools and create jobs in a country plagued by unemployment. </p>

        <h2>The Craft</h2>
        <img src="{{ 'Paula-Craft-1.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>Every Paula | Coles Haiti product is a unique work of art, a canvas of culture and creativity. Using 100% of recycled fabric scraps from t-shirt manufacturing factories in Haiti, Paula Coles hopes to create a brighter future for thousands of underprivileged children in Haiti while also caring for our planet. </p>

        <h2>The Impact</h2>
        <img src="{{ 'Paula-Impact-1.jpg' | asset_url }}">
        <br><br>
        <p>With each Paula | Coles Haiti product purchased you directly pay for ONE of the annual tuition fees for one child. Depending on the subvention you choose, you associate your purchase specifically to one of the following tuition fees: classes, uniforms (mandatory), books, school supplies and computer classes.</p>

              <h2>ONE ARTISAN AT A TIME</h2>
              <h5>The Mission of {{collection.title}}</h5>
              <p>Urban Zen aims to help develop, market and present the work of Haiti artisans to the western world. As an ambassador to the preservation of Haiti’s artistry and expression, Donna Karan and a community of supporters have been traveling to Haiti at every opportunity, working one-on-one with the artists and manufacturers. “The artistry and skill is breathtaking,” Donna says. “I am so inspired by what I am seeing and the people with whom I’m working with. I couldn’t be more excited.”</p>
